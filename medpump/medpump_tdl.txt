what's the goal?
  make it pump an interval - done
  track the remaining volume - done
  stop when infusion is complete - done
  check if there's a stop command
  ask to resume or to exit to navigation

tasks:

--done--
  pump -
    print "drip"
    time.sleep(60/drip_rate)
  track volume -
    volume remaining = total_volume
    while total_volume > 0:
      pump once
      volume remaining = total_volume - (100/drip_set)
    if volume remaining = 0:
      print "Infusion complete!"
--/done--

  check if stop command -
    resume-

    exit to nav-
      navigation()
